Experiment 2 differs from Experiment 1 only in the choice of colors used for the stimuli.

I used the stim colors in this paper:

Levari, D. E., Gilbert, D. T., Wilson, T. D., Sievers, B., Amodio, D. M., & Wheatley, T. (2018). Prevalence-induced concept change in human judgment. Science, 360(6396), 1465-1467.

(Colors given in supplementary material: LEVARI2018COMPLETE.pdf on my machine)

Reason: they found a frequency effect for these colors and that gives us a principled chance to find a frequency effect in our experiment too.

their purple extreme: <br>
RGB(100,0,155)

their blue extreme: <br>
RGB(1,0,254)

their stated midpoint: <br>
RGB(51,0,204) purple <br>
RGB(50,0,205) blue

So I chose to divide that range across 10 stimuli like this: <br>
100,0,155 (purple) <br>
 89,0,166 <br>
 78,0,177 <br>
 67,0,188 <br>
 56,0,199 <br>
 45,0,210 <br>
 34,0,221 <br>
 23,0,232 <br>
 12,0,243 <br>
  1,0,254 (blue)
